# troubleshooting
- sometimes wireshark is **cking up, i have to start wireshark first and handle update stuff 
- i recomment to start wireshark and also the tool with admin rights, otherwise there could be some rights conflicts here
- i just use "Ethernet" here, maybe you have to switch to WLAN when using another connection type 

# tool uses 
- NwJS Gui
- FS (Filesystem) for a batch file to start up the tshark

# thanks
- to Bashprix, was a funny theorycrafting time bro!
- to all the Legendary Members - you make legendary legendary!
- to our whatsapp group - even they don't know the script, we had a rly cool time 

# last words:
I know this isn't a good code, but i love to try out what i can do here - i didn't used that such often.
The EU Servers are shutting down in next month, and this is what i like to give to the US community.
Lets see if the developers like to show how fast they are to fix this (or even not)

like to say that i love the game - but, developers destroyed it.
but i hope that some players on US still have some fun - but i hope that you all don't pay any $ to this.

let it end with a:

KAAAAAMEEEEE HAAAAAAAMEEEEE HAAAA!
